<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lacrimal Stents and Intubation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Stents</li><li>Bicanalicular Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lacrimal stents and intubation systems are medical devices used to maintain patency in the tear drainage system, facilitating proper tear flow. Monocanalicular stents are designed for single canaliculus placement, providing less invasive solutions for tear duct obstruction. In contrast, bicanalicular stents traverse both canaliculi, offering enhanced drainage support for more complex cases. Both types enhance patient comfort, reduce complications, and can be used in various ophthalmological procedures, catering to different severity levels of lacrimal obstructions.</p></p>
