<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Discharge Lamp Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure Discharge Lamp</li><li>High Intensity Gas Discharge Lamp</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas discharge lamps are categorized mainly into two types: low pressure discharge lamps and high-intensity gas discharge lamps. Low pressure discharge lamps, such as neon or fluorescent lights, operate at lower energy levels, producing efficient illumination with a softer glow, suitable for general lighting. In contrast, high-intensity gas discharge lamps, including metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps, generate intense light suitable for outdoor and industrial applications. Both types leverage gas ionization to produce light, but their applications and technologies differ significantly.</p></p>
