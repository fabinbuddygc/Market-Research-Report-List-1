<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Fixation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyaxial</li><li>Monoaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pedicle screw fixation market is primarily divided into two types: polyaxial and monoaxial screws. Polyaxial screws feature a movable connection that allows angling in multiple directions, providing greater flexibility for spinal alignment and minimizing stress on surrounding structures. In contrast, monoaxial screws have a fixed design, limiting movement to a single axis, which can offer increased stability. The choice between the two types often depends on the specific clinical requirements of spinal surgery and patient anatomy.</p></p>
