<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IgG2b Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Monoclonal Antibody"</li><li>"Polyclonal Antibody"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IgG2b antibody market can be categorized into two primary types: monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single clone of immune cells and target specific antigens, offering high consistency and specificity for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple immune cell lines, resulting in a mixture that can recognize various epitopes, providing a broader response but with less consistency. Both types play crucial roles in research, diagnostics, and targeted therapies.</p></p>
