<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial pressure monitoring market is divided into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive monitoring involves the insertion of devices like catheters into the skull to directly measure pressure, offering precise readings but carrying risks like infection. Non-invasive methods, such as transcranial Doppler ultrasound and MRI techniques, assess intracranial pressure without surgical intervention, making them safer but often less accurate. Both methods are crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions like traumatic brain injury and hemorrhage, catering to diverse clinical needs.</p></p>
